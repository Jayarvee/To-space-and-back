The chonker that started it all.
Billy was the first wombat I met in person and it was after meeting her that I started following wombat rescue accounts on Instagram like xx, yy and zz. These volunteers take in orphaned joeys and care for them until they're old enough and fat enough for release back into the wild. Adult wombats are solitary, nocturnal grumps and are **not** pets.
