Merindah<sup>\*</sup> was the first wombat whose journey I followed from initial rescue to release. She wasn't brought into care as a joey but was rescued after she was found in a storm drain with some terrible injuries. <br>
<br>
Her carer Lindy (aka [crazy_wombat_lady](http://instagram.com/crazy_cat_lady) on Instagram) suspects she was an orphan at less than a year old when she was attacked by bigger, territorial wombats. <br>

<sup>\*</sup>Merindah is the Gadigal word for *beautiful*.
